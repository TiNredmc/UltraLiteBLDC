@W: MT529 :"c:\users\thipo\onedrive\documents\devtlhx\fpga\icecube_project\ultralite_bldc_drv\top.v":233:0:233:5|Found inferred clock top|sysclk_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including i2c_steps[4:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
